Hello there! In this post, I want to share with you the tools that I have been using on my workflow and helped me become more productive and efficient. This is a always evolving page, so I'll try to keep track of what has changed through the years and why. Inspired by [Wes Bos's **uses.tech**](https://uses.tech/).

## Applications ‚å®Ô∏è

### IDEs

Starting with my development-related applications, two are mandatory for me:

**Intellij IDEA Ultimate**. Since I work as a professor, I have a license to use the Ultimate version of Intellij IDEA, and honestly, it's by far the best IDE to work with Java related technologies/frameworks such as Spring Boot.

**Visual Studio code**. My main app for software development and anything related, except Java code. My VSCode configuration in terms of extensions changes a lot dependending on what I've been studying/doing lately. But in general, there are some I always have installed: [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag), [Change Case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case), [CodeSnap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap), [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost), [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode), [Wakatime](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime).

The **theme** I use in both IDEs is **Noctis Minimus**.

The **editor font** I use is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

### Other applications I use daily

**Spotify**. My main music app since 2014. I hate the podcast section inside the app but I still use it anyway. Check [my playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/diogodmoreira?si=ec78266e7ccf4268).

[**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies software installation on macOS. There isn't much to talk about this, everyone that happens to use a Linux system before couldn't live without a package manager.

**iTerm2**. ZSH + **[Oh-my-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)**. On top of this configuration, I'm using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

[**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/). I dropped Notion some time because I really want to have control of my notes/files. Obsidian can work offline and even if it dies tomorrow, I have all my files and can edit them in any other Markdown Editor of my choice. Also it is highly extensible in a way that Notion could never be.

[**Magnet**](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12). I don't know if these days, MacOS has a solution similar to that one, but since I bought that app in the past and I'm very used to it, here's my recommendation of an app to window arrangement. It's very useful, specially when working with more than one monitor.

[**DBeaver**](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver). It works with a lot of different database engines, and when you're working with a lot of different databases, dealing with different clients tied to a specific DB could be annoying sometimes.

There are also other applications I use daily, but I don't have any specific reason to use them (besides work): **Slack**, **Google Chrome**, **Postman**, **1Password**.

## Academic Stuff üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

[**MacTeX**](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) to compile my LaTeX files edited on [**TeXStudio**](https://www.texstudio.org/).

**Google Slides**. To create and present my slides during my classes, but it's something I want to replace for TeX + Beamer.

[**Gitbook**](https://gitbook.io). Some of my class content is posted as a dedicated website via Gitbook. It's pretty simple and can be very useful sometimes, specially because it provides some other features such as search.
