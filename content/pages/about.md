For those who are new here, let me introduce myself. My name is Diogo Dantas Moreira, born and living in Brazil.

I enjoy playing video games, particularly role-playing games. I also enjoy reading, although I wish I had more time for it. I love watching animes, TV series, and movies, especially drama and those related to science fiction and fantasy themes. Take a look at some of the things I'm into lately here.

I'm a soccer fan and S√£o Paulo FC supporter. Lately I've been enjoying Formula 1 as well.

I also love traveling, experiencing new cultures, trying new things, and most importantly, spending time with friends and family while enjoying a good beer üçª.

I hold a degree in System Analysis and Development from the Federal Institute of Para√≠ba, where I later worked as an adjunct professor. I completed my specialization in Software Engineering in 2015 and my master's degree in the same field from 2017 to 2019, during which I discovered my passion for Software Testing. Currently, I teach subjects related to Software Engineering, Software Testing, and Design Patterns. You can expect to see posts about web development and software testing here, the areas I've been studying extensively lately.

Gradually, I'll share more about my life and interests here.
