Hello there! In this post, I want to share with you the tools that I have been using on my workflow and helped me become more productive and efficient. This is a always evolving post, so I'll try to keep track of what has changed through the years and why. Inspired by [Wes Bos's **uses.tech**](https://uses.tech/).

## Applications ‚å®Ô∏è

- **Visual Studio code**. My main app for software development and anything related. My VSCode configuration in terms on theme, font and extensions changes a lot dependending on what I've been studying/doing lately. Here's my current setup:
  - **Editor font**: [Input](https://input.djr.com/download/). It doesn't support font ligatures but it's something that I've stopped using lately, since it confuses some explanations on my classes (arrow functions, for example).
  - **Theme**: [Aura Soft Dark (Soft Text)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DaltonMenezes.aura-theme#:~:text=Open%20the%20Extensions%20sidebar%20in%20VS%20Code%20Search,Preferences%3A%20Color%20Theme%20and%20choose%20an%20Aura%20variant)
  - **Extensions**: CodeSnap. Image Preview. Import Cost. Jest. Jest Snippets. Live Server. Markdown All In One. Prettier. Rainbow CSV. Template String Converter. Wakatime.
- **Spotify**. My main music app since 2014, I hate the podcast section inside the app but I still use it anyway. Check [my playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/diogodmoreira?si=ec78266e7ccf4268).
- **Intellij IDEA Ultimate**. Since I work as a professor, I have a license to use the Ultimate version of Intellij IDEA, and honestly, it's by far the best IDE to work with Java related technologies/frameworks such as Spring Boot.
- **Insomnia**/Postman. I've used Postman a lot before, however, Insomnia is managing to meet all my needs lately, I can't give a specific reason for switching.
- **iTerm2 w/ ZSH + [Oh-my-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)**. On top of this configuration, I'm using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).
- **Notion**.
- **Slack**.
- **DBeaver**.
- **Microsoft Edge**.
- **Homebrew**.
