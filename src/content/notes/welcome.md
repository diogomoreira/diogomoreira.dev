Welcome to **my website**. Here, I aim to share a glimpse into my life, including my personal interests, thoughts on various subjects, and discoveries I've made as a technology enthusiast or through my academic research.

For those who are new here, let me introduce myself. My name is **Diogo Dantas Moreira**, and I hold a degree in **System Analysis and Development** from the [Federal Institute of Para√≠ba](https://ifpb.edu.br), where I later worked as an adjunct professor. I completed my specialization in **Software Engineering** in 2015 and my master's degree in the same field from 2017 to 2019, during which I discovered my passion for **Software Testing**. Currently, I teach subjects related to **Software Engineering**, **Software Testing**, and **Design Patterns**.

Aside from work, I enjoy playing video games, particularly role-playing games. I also enjoy reading, although I wish I had more time for it. I love watching anime, TV series, and movies, especially those related to science fiction and fantasy themes. I'm a football fan and support S√£o Paulo FC. I also love traveling, experiencing new cultures, trying new things, and most importantly, spending time with friends and family while enjoying a good beer üçª.

In terms of content, expect to see posts about web development and software testing, the areas I've been studying extensively lately. Gradually, I'll share more about my life and interests here.

I hope you enjoy the content I post, and I welcome any suggestions or requests in the comments section below. üòä
