      <h1>üëãüèª About me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>my website</strong>. Here, I aim to share a glimpse
        into my life, including my personal interests, thoughts on various
        subjects, and discoveries I've made as a technology enthusiast or
        through my academic research.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who are new here, let me introduce myself. My name is{" "}
        <strong>Diogo Dantas Moreira</strong>, and I hold a degree in{" "}
        <strong>System Analysis and Development</strong> from the{" "}
        <a href="https://ifpb.edu.br">Federal Institute of Para√≠ba</a>, where I
        later worked as an adjunct professor. I completed my specialization in{" "}
        <strong>Software Engineering</strong> in 2015 and my master's degree in
        the same field from 2017 to 2019, during which I discovered my passion
        for <strong>Software Testing</strong>. Currently, I teach subjects
        related to <strong>Software Engineering</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Software Testing</strong>, and <strong>Design Patterns</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from work, I enjoy playing video games, particularly role-playing
        games. I also enjoy reading, although I wish I had more time for it. I
        love watching anime, TV series, and movies, especially those related to
        science fiction and fantasy themes. I'm a football fan and support S√£o
        Paulo FC. I also love traveling, experiencing new cultures, trying new
        things, and most importantly, spending time with friends and family
        while enjoying a good beer üçª.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of content, expect to see posts about web development and
        software testing, the areas I've been studying extensively lately.
        Gradually, I'll share more about my life and interests here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you enjoy the content I post, and I welcome any suggestions or
        requests in the comments section below. üòä
