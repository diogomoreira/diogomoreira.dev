          For those who are new here, let me introduce myself. My name is <strong>Diogo Dantas Moreira</strong>, born
          and living in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy playing video games, particularly role-playing games. I also enjoy reading, although I wish I had more
          time for it. I love watching anime, TV series, and movies, especially those related to science fiction and
          fantasy themes. Take a look at some of the things I&apos;m into lately <Link href={"/links"}>here</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a soccer fan and <b>S√£o Paulo FC</b> supporter. Lately I&apos;ve been enjoying Formula 1 as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love traveling, experiencing new cultures, trying new things, and most importantly, spending time with
          friends and family while enjoying a good beer üçª.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a degree in <strong>System Analysis and Development</strong> from the{" "}
          <a href="https://ifpb.edu.br">Federal Institute of Para√≠ba</a>, where I later worked as an adjunct professor.
          I completed my specialization in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> in 2015 and my master&apos;s degree in
          the same field from 2017 to 2019, during which I discovered my passion for <strong>Software Testing</strong>.
          Currently, I teach subjects related to <strong>Software Engineering</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>Software Testing</strong>, and <strong>Design Patterns</strong>. You can expect to see posts about web
          development and software testing here, the areas I&apos;ve been studying extensively lately.
        </p>
        <p>Gradually, I&apos;ll share more about my life and interests here.</p>
