Hello, welcome to **new version of my website**. On this personal site I seek
share a little of my life, whether in relation to my personal tastes,
impressions about some subject or discoveries that I have been making as an enthusiast
technology or my academic research.

To those who are here for the first time, allow me to introduce myself. My name is **Diogo
Moreira**, I have a degree in **System Analysis and Development** at
[Federal Institute of ParaÃ­ba](https://ifpb.edu.br), an institution that was already
my second home since high school, and where I later became
servant as effective teacher. Completed my specialization in Engineering
Software in 2015 and I did my master's degree in this area from 2017 to 2019, where
I discovered my passion for the area of â€‹â€‹**Software Testing**. Today I teach
disciplines related to Software Engineering, Software Testing and Patterns
of Projects.

Not to mention just work, in my free time I like to play video games,
mainly roleplaying games. I like to read, although I read a lot less than I do.
would. I enjoy watching animes, series and movies, usually related to themes
as science fiction/fantasy. I like football and I'm a fan of **SÃ£o Paulo
FC**. I love to travel, discover new cultures, have new experiences and
mainly to drink a good beer and enjoy a good time with friends and
relatives.

As for the contents that I intend to post here, expect some posts about
_web_ development and software testing, which are the areas I'm studying
more often lately.

Little by little I also hope to share a little more of my life and my
likes around here. I hope you like the content I'm going to post and I'm open to
suggestions and requests, including in the comments box at the end of the post. ðŸ˜Š
